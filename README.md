AbbyLarby is a Slack bot for connecting to generative AI helpers.

# Features

## /ai slash command

Available commands:
* `/ai <prompt>`: Show the OpenAI text API's response to `<prompt>`. Visible only to you.
* `/ai img <prompt>`: Show the Dall-E image generated by `<prompt>`. Visible only to you.
* `/ai say <prompt>` or * `/ai say img <prompt>`: immediately post the result to the channel.

## Conversation bot

Have a longer conversation by talking directly with the bot in the app Messages tab.

The bot can also be added to any channel, and then will respond to @ mentions.

## Conversation bot hidden URL

The conversation bot can fetch a hidden prompt from any URL stored in `HIDDEN_PROMPT_URL`.
All paragraph tags, whose text does not start with `#`, will be included as paragraphs at the
start of the hidden prompt. The URL will be refetched once every five minutes. A Google Doc
that is published to the web works well as a hidden prompt URL.

# Dev setup

(lazy requirements for now)

    pip install requirements.txt

Copy .env.example to .env and write credentials.

Run dev server:

    watchmedo auto-restart python aibot.py

This uses sockets to talk to Slack, so dev bot will be live if you're using live credentials.

# Server hosting

Just keep `python aibot.py` running on the server. See `Procfile` for running with Dokku.
